# Hands on Machine Learning project details
This project is done simulatinously while reading the book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow.
The purpose of this project is to develope an understanding about the ideas that I discover while studying this group and gain some familiarity with ML algorithms.
During the timescale of this project, I'll be practicing some ideas not found in this book.
